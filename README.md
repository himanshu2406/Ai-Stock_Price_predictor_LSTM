# Ai-Stock_Price_predictor_LSTM
Based on LSTM - An Rnn That predicts the future stock prices


Simplified_LSTM_RNN Predicts future stock prices of Reliance, This simplified model is built with the help of keras;

Dataset for reliance stocks taken from : https://in.finance.yahoo.com/quote/RELIANCE.NS/history?period1=1422748800&period2=1577836800&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d

Reliance(1).csv is the training set while Reliance(2).csv is the test set in which the future 20 days opening values are set to constant for no reason other than ease of code for predicting the future prices ; the prediction starts from when the line flattens in the graph

Exact values can't be determined but approximate trends can be foretold , for example - a falling trend for the next 10 days can be seen here.
